sticky notes app i made a while ago when i was practicing js, saw some guide on it and decided to do it myself, i think it turned out pretty okay, struggled getting the
delete button to look good, but i came back to it today and fixed it, thought id upload it just in case.

has local storage and thats about it, its pretty simple just a lot of css to make it look good
